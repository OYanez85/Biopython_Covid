Biopython_3D_SARS-CoV-19-Protein_Visualization
Introductory Read In the fields of Bioinformatics, Health and Medical Technology & Biotechnology, there is now a widespread need for visualization tools to present the 3D structure of proteins. There are only a few examples of protein function. A remarkable fact is that all tasks they can perform are based on a common principle, the twenty amino acids that can form a protein. That is the reason why studying proteins, their composition, structure, dynamics and function, is so important.

We must understand how these molecules fold, how they assemble into complexes, how they function if we wish to answer questions such as why we have cancer, why we grow old, why we get sick, how can we find cures for many diseases, why life as we know it has evolved in this way and on this planet and not anywhere else, at least for the moment.

All proteins functions are dependent on their structure, which, in turn, depends on physical and chemical parameters. This is another important fact on studying these molecules; classical biological, physical, chemical, mathematical and informatics sciences have been working together in a new area known as bioinformatics to allow a new level of knowledge about life organization. To understand structural biology, visualization of complex macromolecular structure (like proteins) is essential and macromolecular structure visualization is also now one of the primary steps in the process of drug design and discovery and docking studies. These studies are done virtually thus reducing animal trials and manpower.

Biopython
Now we will create an interactive three-dimensional (3D) representation of SARS-CoV-19 (Coronavirus) protein structures. We will accomplish it in by completing each task in the project:

Task 1: Introduction to Biopython

Task 2: Understand FASTA file format

Task 3: Sequence manipulation using Biopython

Task 4: Transcription & Translation studies

Task 5: Perform Basic Local Alignment using NCBI-BLAST

Task 6: Reading PDB file

Task 7: Visualizing SARS-CoV-19 Protein structures
